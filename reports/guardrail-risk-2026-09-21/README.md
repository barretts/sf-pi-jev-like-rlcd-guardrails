# Guardrail risk replacement evidence, 2026-09-21

This report separates source/interface proof, actual Pi SDK execution with mocks,
RFDT training, native candidate qualification and production acceptance. The
candidate 2 is **rejected and unqualified**. Its real native SF bridge validation
completed with zero unsafe allows and warm p95 208.353 ms, but produced 75
unnecessary interruptions versus three for the baseline. This fails the
equal-or-better usability requirement. Optimizer updates, checkpoint checks,
exact adapter reload and separate F16 export completed. No improvement,
held-out qualification or production acceptance claim is made here.

The isolated worktrees use `barretts/jev-guardrail-risk`: Jev at
`/private/tmp/simple-jev-ts-guardrail-risk-20260921`, based on `95c0b50`, and sf-pi
at `/private/tmp/sf-pi-guardrail-risk-20260921`, based on `4f901db9`. The default
general classifier remains unchanged. The separate guardrail candidate uses
`google/gemma-3-1b-it@dcc83ea841ab6100d6b47a070329e1ba4cf78752` and the existing
RFDT pipeline. No excluded model lineage, derivative, teacher or fallback is
introduced.

The SF integration has a local source checkpoint
`beaa11c057c84e96b4d53b57ac1fdfe9c7a2a2d2`; it has not been pushed. Its tree is
`85351e72e8a5d8cecfd64914eb9a6ea46edd405b`. The
[baseline-bound integration patch](../../integrations/sf-pi-guardrail/0001-feat-guardrail-support-an-optional-local-Jev-risk-pr.patch)
has SHA-256 `db3d9350616b3e9709b442fc7a0d4678c17704a06bc82da121ccd86f36e95b7d`
and 133,579 bytes. Applying it to baseline
`4f901db9c3f5076ea0305dea33ad6e8856e467da` in a temporary index reproduced the
committed tree. This proves patch delivery integrity; it does not activate a
Pi host or publish the integration.

The [operation-policy rubric](../../fixtures/guardrail/RUBRIC.md) supplies gold
independently of the current engine. Labels are machine authored from inspected
public implementation; human review remains pending. The
[corpus](../../fixtures/guardrail/corpus.json) contains 612 cases in 204 groups:

| Split         | All cases | Eligible semantic calls | Passed to RFDT training preparation |
| ------------- | --------: | ----------------------: | ----------------------------------- |
| Train         |       285 |                     252 | Yes                                 |
| Validation    |       165 |                     144 | Yes, as a separate validation split |
| Held-out test |       162 |                     141 | No; prepared test file is empty     |

Related variants stay in one operation group and split. Static checks require
shell, Herdr, file policy, Salesforce, Apex, AgentScript, Data 360, SOQL, Canvas
and browser coverage. Every semantic family contains safe and risky cases in
each split; exact-policy block cases are retained separately. Data 360 requests
include source-catalog required keys, with manual REST/readiness dispatcher
actions checked separately.

The corpus SHA-256 is
`f04d11f220f8f167a579e0fd3f466a1d47f2c0a612fb1411ee264bfc34675ee2`.
The actual baseline kernel, using generic mocked host facts and no tool
execution, produced 30 unsafe allows and 17 unnecessary interruptions: 47
disagreements with the fixed gold rubric. All exact-policy floor outputs matched
gold. These numbers describe this finite authored corpus only.

| Candidate   | Observed training status                                                                                                                                  | Selection/qualification                                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate 1 | Stopped at update 42/256 after review found two incomplete Data 360 rehearsal parameter sets. The old corpus, plan and abandonment receipt are preserved. | Abandoned; no held-out model calls.                                                              |
| Candidate 2 | Fresh pinned Google base; corrected corpus; all 256 planned updates and checkpoint/reload checks completed. Separate F16 export recorded.                 | Native validation complete; rejected by usability gate; no prospective freeze or held-out calls. |

Candidate 2's training loss decreased from 4.7091871897 to 0.6262149849; the
adapter changed and reload maximum probability delta was zero. Training-phase
duration was 954.204 seconds. The worker checked rendered prompt tokens and
answer-label boundaries on 396 train/validation rows and 792 labels. The export
receipt identifies `jev/gemma-3-1b-guardrail-candidate-2`, SHA-256
`b67734870cc03c0b34ece18d00dc55b5b0c9686fe211635aed81f61ebc4cbc17`,
2,006,573,408 bytes. Learning, checkpoint reload and export integrity remain
separate from native bridge qualification.

The [complete native bridge validation receipt](./sf-bridge-validation.json)
contains all 165 validation records across 55 groups, with original case IDs,
input hashes and comparison evidence. All 144 eligible calls completed through
the real SF bridge/local Jev worker; no requested dangerous tool executed and no
fallback concealed a model failure. The independent host facts remain authored
fixtures.

| Validation criterion        | Candidate 2 | Baseline / requirement         | Result   |
| --------------------------- | ----------: | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Unsafe automatic allows     |           0 | Baseline 14; required 0        | Pass     |
| Existing safety regressions |           0 | Required 0                     | Pass     |
| Exact hard-block demotions  |           0 | Required 0                     | Pass     |
| Unnecessary interruptions   |          75 | Baseline 3; required at most 3 | **Fail** |
| Warm risk-check p95, ms     |  208.353333 | Required at most 500           | Pass     |
| Eligible calls answered     |   144 / 144 | Every eligible call            | Pass     |
| Execution errors/fallbacks  |           0 | Required 0                     | Pass     |

Cold initialization was 2,548.651041 ms and is excluded from the warm latency
distribution. The measurement SHA-256 is
`beaee8cffff9d525abaf036a75fa51c55c4e8d8963542b353fbf1b255360c09b`;
native executable SHA-256 is
`7fafa2a0eb864489aeca740767fd3c7a8fda46f8c61e6ce1af9a5e71d9846b96`.
Its final runtime baseline SHA-256 is
`0f31a95043fc761347a9ccc51dc673b6aaea77d9ca61bd129f789eaa51fa1f45`.
The rejection receipt remains under the candidate's ignored run directory.
No candidate freeze was created and no held-out model inference occurred.

An 18-case TRAIN-only overfit diagnosis is running to investigate
learning and scoring behavior before another candidate. Its 256 updates are
fixed in advance and it receives no validation/test targets. No diagnostic
result is recorded at this checkpoint; neither the rubric nor qualification
gates are changed using the rejected validation outcome.

Candidate 2's preparation binds the original bundle SHA-256
`6381f6dc8c94de22105a417d95265a90ec798a3c36d18784f61a1c04c06dbc83` and its then-current
baseline/provenance SHA-256
`0db5db3546345a9058451450ed4f6eb4e3472944bcc2be367743f82dc99f720c`.
Later SF hardening separates runtime baseline identity from full exporter
provenance. A final bridge evaluation/freeze must use the final runtime identity;
the preparation identity is retained as history rather than overwritten.

Source tests cover provider discovery, strict input/response checks, failure
fallback, cancellation, qualification tampering, changed identities, worker
lifecycle and approval behavior. Final Jev source checks passed 1,011 tests
across 46 files in 10.44 seconds with isolated Pi state and narrowly escalated
local fixture listeners. TypeScript/package checks, build, 38 focused guardrail
tests across four files and formatting also passed. SF guardrail/runtime checks
passed 315 tests (one further test skipped), and six actual Pi SDK tests passed.
SF lint, docs build and validation stages before the full-suite stage passed.
Every SF test file was exercised in the appropriate isolated environment:

| SF test partition         | Observed result                        | Environment / boundary                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broad suite, 593 files    | 4,214 passed / one failed / 40 skipped | Logging disabled, ordinary agent-directory environment, `NO_COLOR` unset. Only failure was an unrelated AgentScript dynamic-import five-second timeout. |
| Timeout replay            | Four tests passed in 2.27 s            | Affected file alone after other checks stopped; three passes overlap the broad run.                                                                     |
| Six state-sensitive files | 70 tests passed                        | Isolated Pi agent directory; user global state preserved.                                                                                               |
| Two localhost files       | Eight tests passed                     | Narrowly escalated local fixtures; no global-state writes or external operations.                                                                       |

This partition/replay coverage does not establish a successful uniform
`npm test` or `validate:ci` command. Earlier uniform sandbox attempts reported
4,273 passes / 20 failures / 40 skips / nine errors with the agent-directory
environment unset, and 4,227 passes / 66 failures / 40 skips / eight errors with
a forced isolated directory. Fixtures bind HOME/agent-directory state;
`NO_COLOR`, blocked global SF log writes and localhost `EPERM` also affected
those attempts. Partition results are not summed into a unique grand total.

The package dry run passed with 171 files, 6,158,422 unpacked bytes and 1,270,707
tarball bytes at that checkpoint. Required guardrail sources, corpus, scripts
and patch were included; weights were excluded. These measurements precede
the final documentation update and do not identify a sealed final archive.
Source, package and patch checks do not qualify the local model.

The actual SDK workflow exercises `AgentSession.prompt` and `ExtensionRunner`
with scripted inference and counter-only custom tools:

| Mode   | Accepted requests | Confirmations | Session grants | Retries | Errors | SDK setup ms | Workflow ms | Total ms |
| ------ | ----------------: | ------------: | -------------: | ------: | -----: | -----------: | ----------: | -------: |
| Off    |                 2 |             1 |              1 |       0 |      0 |        4.420 |       1.425 |    5.845 |
| Shadow |                 2 |             1 |              1 |       0 |      0 |        2.660 |       3.135 |    5.795 |

The SDK setup time is not model cold initialization. A separate real-hook stub
workflow accepted all three operations with two confirmations and zero retries
in each of `off`, `shadow` and `enforce`; its observed elapsed times were 1.152,
5.250 and 3.267 ms. Those timings describe mocks and cannot establish model
latency or workflow improvement. No dangerous external operation was executed.

The identical-operation SDK workflow does not establish session-approval prompt
parity for changed related operations. Current model-derived grants bind to an
exact operation, active policy, model and protocol; baseline family grants may
reuse approval more broadly. This remains a usability limitation requiring
matched real-model workflow evidence. Novel model risks retain allow-once scope.

Automatic approval review rejected restoring the baseline's implicit session
approval option. The conservative current model-confirmation session setting
is pending an explicit user decision. This limitation remains separate from
the candidate's observed validation rejection.

Qualification requires zero unsafe automatic allows, zero safety regressions,
zero hard-block demotions, unnecessary interruptions at or below the measured
baseline, all eligible model calls completed without fallback/errors, and warm
p95 ≤500 ms including preparation and queueing. Safe logits must win with an
uncalibrated score ≥0.99. Validation alone selects a candidate; its weights,
protocol, cutoff, case inventory, criteria, native binary and runtime baseline
are frozen before any held-out model inference. A failed gate rejects the
candidate and preserves the current engine.

[evidence.json](./evidence.json) contains the compact checkpoint ledger. The
candidate's failed validation and separate cold initialization are recorded;
held-out results and real-model matched workflows remain unset until their
authoritative receipts exist. Large raw runs, adapters and weights remain
under ignored `.build/guardrail/`; no raw weights are part of this report.

Runtime defaults to `off`; `shadow` records comparisons while the original
engine enforces; qualified `enforce` is operator opt-in. Exact policy and the
single existing approval/audit owner remain in place. Corpus qualification,
matched real-model workflow effectiveness and production acceptance are
separate proof boundaries.
